# odin-rock-paper-scissors
## The Odin Project Project 3
This exercise asks to build a simple programme that lets a human play rock-paper-scissors against the computer.\
It is intended to test the following JavaScript concepts:
- data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- variables (const, let, var)
- functions (declaration, return statement)
- if statements and logical operators (and, or, not)
